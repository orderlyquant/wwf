**R workflows: working with files**

This repository was started as part of my work with the
Excel/R Working Group.

It contains R scripts and code demonstrating good practices
for working with numerous data files. The examples have
the beginning R user in mind: someone with a background in
Excel (may know VBA) making the transition to R.

Topics covered:

- simple processing of repetitive files


## TODO

- Rmarkdown/Quarto documents with detailed explanations
